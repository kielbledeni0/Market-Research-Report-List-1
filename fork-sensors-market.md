<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fork Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PNP-NO</li><li>PNP-NC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fork sensors are vital in automation and industrial applications for detecting the presence of objects. The PNP-NO (Normally Open) type activates an output when an object is detected, making it suitable for applications where detection is required to trigger an action. Conversely, the PNP-NC (Normally Closed) type maintains an active output until an object is detected, ideal for safety applications where presence must interrupt a system. Both types cater to specific operational needs in manufacturing and logistics environments.</p></p>
