<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Toxicity Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionizing Radiation</li><li>Non-ionizing Radiation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radiation toxicity therapeutics market is categorized into two main types: ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation, which includes X-rays and gamma rays, has enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, leading to cellular damage and increasing cancer risk. Therapeutics in this area focus on mitigating these effects, using drugs or therapies to repair or protect damaged tissues. Non-ionizing radiation, such as ultraviolet light and radiofrequency, poses lower risk, with therapies aimed at treating conditions arising from excessive exposure.</p></p>
